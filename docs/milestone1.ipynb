Manual differentiation is the calculation of the derivative expression by hand and its coding. It is time-consuming and prone to error especially as systems become more complex. Numerical differentiation is the finite difference approximation of the derivative using values of the original function evaluated at points. Its advantage is that it is easy to implement whilst its disadvantage is truncation and round-off errors. Symbolic differentiation uses packages such as Mathematica, to produce the exact derivative expression as its output. It addresses the weaknesses of manual and numerical differentiation; however, it frequently results in “expression swell”. Expression swell is the phenomenon of much larger representation of a derivative as opposed to representation of the original function. Symbolic differentiation does not consider the fact that many sub-expressions in the different derivative expressions are common. This leads to inefficiency in its calculation. Symbolic and manual differentiation require the model to be defined as closed-form expressions which limits the expressivity of the model as it cannot use branches or loops. The fourth technique, automatic differentiation (AD), obtains the exact result of the derivative by breaking down the expression into elementary arithmetic operations and elementary functions and applying the chain rule to the derivatives of these operations.\n","\n","# Background\n","\n","## **Automatic Differentiation**\n","\n","The key idea of Automatic Differentation is to decompose the calculations into elementary functions and  evaluate the functions derivative by combining each elementary function's derivative by using the chain rule.\n","\n","\n","## **Chain Rule**\n","\n","The **chain rule** is a method to differentiate composite functions. This is especially useful in automatic differentation when extended to the multivariate case.\n","\n","For example, suppose we have a multivariate function $f(u_{1}(t),u_{2}(t))$ and we want to evaluate the derivative $f$ with respect $t$. Then we have the following expression: \n","\n","$$ \\frac{\\partial f(u_{1}(t),u_{2}(t))}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_{1}}\\frac{\\partial u_{1}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_{2}}\\frac{\\partial u_{2}}{\\partial t}$$\n","\n","The above can also be represented in vector notation. Replacing $t$ with $x \\in R^{m}$, the chain rule can more elegantly be written in terms of the differential vector operator $\\nabla$ with respect to the vector $x$.\n","\n","$$\\nabla_{x}f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_{1}}\\nabla_{x}u_{1}  + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_{2}}\\nabla_{x}u_{2} $$\n","\n","where $f = f(u_{1}(x_{1},...,x_{m}),u_{2}(x_{1},...,x_{m}))$\n","\n","Automatic differentiation commonly involves several dependent variables (i.e intermediate steps), hence we need to generalize the chain rule to support a function $f$ of $n$ other functions (i.e $f((u_{1}(x_{1},...,x_{m}),u_{2}(x_{1},..,x_{m}),..,u_{n}(x_{1},..,x_{m}))$)\n","\n","Now the gradient of $f$ is instead given by: \n","\n","$$\\nabla_{x}f = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_{i}(x)} \\nabla_{x}u_{i}(x)$$\n","\n","where $x \\in R^{m}$\n","\n","\n","## **Compuational Graph**\n","\n","Automatic differentiation can be represented as a graph structure. This is done by decomposing the function into its primitive operations (e.g binary arithmic operations and unary operations). The computation graph is then simply constructed by representing each elementary operation as a node, and connecting each node by an edge. \n","\n","By convention the nodes are represented by the following variables:  \n","- Input variables : $v_{i-m} = x_{i}$ , $i = 1,...,m$\n"," - Intermediate variables: $v_{i}$ , $i = 1,..,n$\n","\n","An example of a computational graph is shown below for the function $f(x)=sin(x_1x_2) + x_2$,\n","\n","```mermaid\n","graph LR;\n","\tx_1 --> v_-1;\n","\tx_2 --> v_0;\n","    v_-1 -- multiply --> v_1;\n","    v_0 -- multiply --> v_1;\n","    v_1 -- sin --> v_2;\n","    v_2 -- add --> v_3;\n","    v_0 -- add --> v_3;\n","    v_3 --> f;\n","```\n","\n","## **Evaluation Trace**\n","\n","The evaluation trace stores the intermediate results $v_{i}$ evaluated at a given point, and includes a tangent trace, which records the directional derivative of each intermediate variable $v_{i}.$ The final derivative of the original function is calculated by combining derivatives of the intermediate results by using the chain rule.\n","\n","Below is an example of an evaluation trace table using the previous example function and computational graph:  \n","  \n","| **Primal Trace**  | **$f(x)$**              |\n","|-------------------|-------------------------|\n","| $v_{-1} = x_1$    | $v_{-1} = x_1$          |\n","| $v_{0} = x_2$     | $v_{0} = x_2$           |\n","| $v_1 = v_{-1}v_0$ | $v_1 = x_1x_2$          |\n","| $v_2 = sin(v_1)$  | $v_2 = sin(x_1x_2)$     |\n","| $v_3 = v_2 +v_0$  | $v_3 = sin(x_1x_2)+x_2$ |\n","  \n","<br>\n","\n","| **Tangent Trace**                                                               | $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}$ --> Direction: $p = [1, 0]^T$ | $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}$ --> Direction: $p = [0, 1]^T$          |\n","|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n","| $D_pv_{-1} = p_1$                                                               | $D_pv_{-1} = 1$                                                 | $D_pv_{-1} = 0$                                                          |\n","| $D_pv_{0} = p_2$                                                                | $D_pv_{0} = 0$                                                  | $D_pv_{0} = 1$                                                           |\n","| $D_pv_{1} = v_{-1}D_pv_{0} + v_{0}D_pv_{-1} = x_1p_2 + x_2 p_1$                 | $D_pv_{1} =x_2 p_1 = x_2$                                       | $D_pv_{1} =x_1 p_0 = x_1$                                                |\n","| $D_pv_{2} = cos(v_1)D_pv_{1}= cos(x_1 x_2)(x_1p_2 + x_2 p_1)$            | $D_pv_{2} = cos(x_1x_2)(x_2 p_1) = cos(x_1 x_2)(x_2)$    | $D_pv_{2} = cos(x_1 x_2)(x_1 p_2)$                                       |\n","| $D_pv_{3} = D_pv_{2} + D_pv_{0} = cos(x_1 x_2)(x_1p_2 + x_2 p_1) + p_2$  | $D_pv_{3} = cos(x_1 x_2)(x_2)$                                  | $D_pv_{3} = cos(x_1 x_2)(x_1 p_2) + p_2 = cos(x_1 x_2)(x_1) + 1$  |\n","\n","\n","  \n","## Seed vector\n","The methods mentioned above describe how to calculate the derivative of a function using a computational graph.

This seed vector described the direction of the desired derivative and is used in the various steps of calculating the derivative.
