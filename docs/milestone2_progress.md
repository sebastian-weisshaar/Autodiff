# Milestone 2B
## Task Assignment
For Milestone 2 we have made the following task assignment: Nora and Robin will work on the functions.py file for the uniary functions. Nora will work on square root, logistic function, trigonometric function  and exponentials.  Robin will work on: inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic functions.

Anna will work as well on the forward mode implementation, by programming the autodiff.py file. Also, Anna will work on the comparison operations on the node class. 

The test suite will be coded by Sebastian. By seperating the test suite from the development of the forward mode we increase the quality of the testing because of the independent development of test and code. 

Nora  and Robin will also both work on the extended documentation and the proposal for the additional features. 


## Task completion
We have created a working schedule for the coming week to complete the mentioned tasks. Furthermore, we read up on the our specific tasks.
